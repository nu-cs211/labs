\maketitle

Today we will be looking at a C++ program using the eecs211 game engine in a simple example game. Provided are the model file which defines the game state and interactions, and a game file which uses the model to create our game and draw the necessary shapes in the correct screen locations. The game is simple, you control two circles on the screen - one with your mouse and one with your keyboard - when the two circles overlap, they change color.

\section{Inverted Arrows}

Currently, there is an error with this code - if you run the program and try to control the circle with your arrow keys you will move in the opposite direction of what you intended. Locate the bug for this and fix it. There are test cases for checking the movement directions so when you are done try running your code against the test classes.

\section{Click not Hover}

Currently, the position of the mouse is always updating the position of its corresponding circle and the color of these circles then changes based on the current position of the mouse. However, we want the game to only update the position of mouse circle when we click. You have seen an example of detecting mouse click events in the previous class materials so consult those for format and functions to use for detecting a click and update the logic for when your program decides to change the color of the circles.

\section{Testing}

The current test file has a few example test functions that should run for your code. Add another to test that the color changes on mouse click.

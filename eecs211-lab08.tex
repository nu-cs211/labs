\maketitle

In this week's lab, we will be going over some cool STL tricks such as iterators, and going over inheritance.


If you have any lingering questions during the lab, don't hesitate to ask your peer mentor!
\section{Getting the code}
Download the zip file from the course site: \medskip

\url{http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jesse/course/eecs211/lab/eecs211-lab08.zip}

\medskip \noindent
After you have downloaded the zip file onto your laptop, extract the zip file into its own folder. Make sure you keep track of which folder it's in!  Next, open up CLion and Click on File --> Open Project, and click on the Lab 8 project that you just unzipped. 

Once you open the project, try building the lab and then running the lab6 executable. 
You should see some output printed in your output subwindow.
If you need a reminder on how to build and run code in CLion, consult lab 3/4 or ask your TA.
Once this works, you're ready to start the lab!

\section{The STL}

\subsection {Iterators}
Iterators are a tool, like many of the things we've learned, that help you abstract away problems to make the solutions easier to adapt to other methods.

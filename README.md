# CS 211 Labs

This is where the source code for CS 211 labs and lab guides is
developed. In order to build the C++ assignments, this directory needs
to contain a subdirectory named dot-cs211 containing the contents of
https://github.com/nu-cs211/dot-cs211.git. You can clone it right there
or clone it somewhere else and symlink.
